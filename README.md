# Vehicle-Rental-Database
Worked in a team of 5 to create and manage a database SQL Server from scratch that was able to keep
track of customers, vehicle rented, rental payments, and vehicle manufacturing
details along with a Web App.
Created an ERD (Crowâ€™s Foot notation) for the database using Lucid Chart.
Created BCNF tables and relationships and loaded data using DDL statements.
The database was also migrated to a MySQL database. 
Worked on various queries such as a subquery, stored procedures, CTE, UDF, Cursor,
pivot, and trigger
My main role included database modelling  and writing SQL queries to create the databases and tables along with subquery, stored procedure to run the basic functionality of vehicle rental database.I also create datawarehouse architecture for the same.
